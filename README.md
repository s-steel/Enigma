# Enigma
Individual Project for Turing School, Backend Mod 1

#### Functionality ####

For this section of the evaluation I feel that my project meets expectations.  The reason for this is that the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods are both successfully implemented and function as specified.  In addition the `encrypt` and `decrypt` command line interfaces are implemented and functioning.

#### Object Oriented Programming ####

I believe that this project meets expectations for this aspect of the evaluation.  My code is broken down into logical components and responsibilities are broken down and keep within the respective classes/modules.  None of the classes are unreasonable large and each keeps to itself.

#### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics ####

For this section I feel that this project meets expectations, verging on above expectations.  Everything is named in a way that explains it purpose, syntax is consistent, and the code is properly formatted.  Though there is two methods just over ten lines, in general all methods are efficient and use the best tool for the job.  

#### Test Driven Development ####

I also feel that for this section of the evaluation this project meets expectations, verging on above expectations.  Test coverage shows 100% coverage and I continuously wrote tests before writing the methods.  Each method has a tests and they verify the expected behavior for each method.  Mocks and stubs are also use to test randomness.

#### Version Control ####

I believe that this project is above expectations for this section of the evaluation.  There is well over 40 commits and each commit is for single pieces of functionality.  These commits are also labeled so that it is clear what was changed.  Each branch/pull request handles one component of the project and is labeled accordingly.  With each pull request there is notes and comments explaining its function and areas of improvement.
